# How to install the package from GitLab:

You can install the development version of CogLearn by running the following code

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_git("git@gitlab.com:bachlab/coglearn/coglearn.git", ref = "main")

```

## NOTE 
(1)the CogLearn package is not currently available on CRAN as it heavily uses 
tidyverse-style non-standard evaluation which is not accepted on CRAN. 
This may change in the future.

(2) After installation, run the following code to use the CogLearn package

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(CogLearn)

```

## Scripts

How to use tidyverse in a package: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/in-packages.html

Quick tips:

* Functions should be in scripts stored in the `R` folder.
* If you need to use functions from another package, you should call them explicitly (e.g. `dplyr::filter(...)`). Dependencies should be added to the imports in the DESCRIPTION file.
* You can use RStudio to [generate documentation skeleton for functions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30675146/5024009).
* Follow the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
