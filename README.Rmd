### How to install the package from GitLab:

You can install the development version of CogLearn by following the steps below

```r
1. Clone the R package CogLearn from the gitlab using the following code (make sure the git is installed):
git clone https://gitlab.com/bachlab/coglearn/coglearn.git

2. Install the dependent R package vrthreat using the following code:
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/bachlab/erc/vrthreat.git", ref = "develop")

3. Install the CogLearn from your local repository
install_local("/path/to/your/local/repository/that store the CogLearn")

```

### NOTE 

1. the CogLearn package is not currently available on CRAN as it heavily uses 
tidyverse-style non-standard evaluation which is not accepted on CRAN. 
This may change in the future.

2. After installation, run the following code to use the CogLearn package

```r
library(vrthreat)
library(CogLearn)

```

How to use tidyverse in a package: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/in-packages.html

Quick tips:

* Functions should be in scripts stored in the `R` folder.
* If you need to use functions from another package, you should call them explicitly (e.g. `dplyr::filter(...)`). Dependencies should be added to the imports in the DESCRIPTION file.
* You can use RStudio to [generate documentation skeleton for functions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30675146/5024009).
* Follow the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
